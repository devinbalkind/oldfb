   <b>Brand Strategy</b><BR><BR>
   
   <P>At Frankfurt Balkind, we believe brand integration begins at the strategic level. That's why our own integration as an agency begins with our unique, 
cross-functional strategic teams.</P>

<P>These teams include corporate, marketing, advertising, and web strategists whose work together delivers strategic solutions that are both scalable and coherent. This is brand strategy that holds together as it is applied across disciplines, geographies, and media.We also recognize that different strategies have different goals.
Business strategy defines your vision and position as a company and develops strategies that drive your business model. Marketing strategy identifies the customer needs that direct your marketing plan. Corporate identity strategy requires ambiguity to allow room for your business to grow and respond to unforeseen change. Advertising strategy provides razor-sharp focus and new customer insight. Web strategy embraces complexity, bringing together disparate elements and creating intuitive usability.
We make sure your brand strategy works coherently with them all.
In addition, we are hypothesis-driven. This approach, in contrast to the more typical research-driven way of working, looks to the future rather than the past, and keeps us outward, rather than inward, focused. 
We believe the important role for research is in gap analysis-where you are versus where you might hypothetically be-to help choose the most viable strategic position.
Our approach can also incorporate: brand profiling, perceptual mapping, brand nucleus definition, trend insights, and cultural and anthropological resonators.
Finally, we link strategy across disciplines through message architecture. This prioritizes and sequences messages to each target audience in the marketing communications plan, informing creative briefs specific to each medium.</P>
