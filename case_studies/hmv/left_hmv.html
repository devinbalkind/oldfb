<B>Launching A Retailer Into The U.S.</B><P></font><font size="-1" face="arial,helvetica">

<B>Situation</B><P>

While unknown to the U.S. before its launch, HMV is the world's largest music retailer with 150 stores worldwide. Scheduled for a summer arrival in the States, HMV had ambitiously planned to open its first two U.S. music superstores in New York - at upper Westside and upper Eastside locations - during the quiet of August.  Our target: all music buyers in all music categories.  Our strategy: to generate broad awareness and word-of-mouth quickly by establishing HMV as the place to be; the place for people who love music- with the service and caring that other NY music stores lacked.<P>

<B>Creative</B><P>

Executionally we created a high visibility identity for HMV which was built into the theme line, "The Music Lives." Advertising featured historical photos of musicians and music lovers who were emotionally "into" their music.  The imagery was echoed in all creative and allowed us to attract audiences across broad genres.<P>

<B>Media</B><P>

Our media objectives were to 1) generate broad awareness of a launch of two new stores quickly among key target audiences; and 2) utilize media vehicles that enhance brand imagery.  We strongly believed that just as important as what we said was how and why we said it.  This principle guided our choice of media vehicles as, within limited budget parameters, we needed to introduce a new retailer to New Yorkers, support dual store openings and maintain interest and visibility throughout the year.  With a strongly image-driven campaign, we used emotion-laden musical-related photography across all "media."  This included TV spots on MTV and VH1, newspaper, radio and outdoor.<P>

Along with bus shelters and phone kiosks, we used wild postings around New York, allowing us to reach the classical music buyers as well as the followers of Hip Hop. We had roller-blade club members decked out in HMV t-shirts and other musical paraphernalia buzz outdoor concerts, skate through Central Park and otherwise be "seen" performing in all the right places - from Battery Park City to Lincoln Center. All shopping bags, in-store posters (for sale and at point-of-purchase), t-shirts, press kits, stationery, and invitations carried the same imagery as the ads. Co-op newspaper ads were given a high visibility HMV format where the H M and V were used as strong graphic devices.<P>

<font size=-2 face=arial,helvetica color="#FFFF99"><b>Results</b><br>

On opening day, more than 5,000 people lined up at store entrances, and sales moved ahead of projections in what was, then, a recession-hit marketplace.</font></td>
