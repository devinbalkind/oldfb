<B>A Cultural Identity for Silicon Valley</B><P>

<B>Background</B><P>

The Tech Museum of Innovation has a mission &quot;to serve as an educational resource that engages people of all ages and backgrounds in exploring and experiencing the technologies affecting their lives, and inspires young people to become innovators in developing technologies of the future.&quot;  The Tech identity, and the way it was applied to marketing and development  materials, did not convey The Techs mission.  With the building of a new $86 million facility, largely sponsored by the community of Silicon Valley, it was imperative that The Tech improve its identity tone that effectively communicated its strategic messages.  The plan would be to unveil the new identity with the grand opening of the new facility in the Fall 1998.</P>

<B>The Challenge</B><P>

We wanted to symbolize The Tech with an identity that created the sense of an institutional and educational resource as well as one that encourages interaction and innovation.  We distilled this message into three words which the identity would represent:  welcoming, engaging and important.  Welcoming because The Tech is committed to encouraging the involvement and interaction of people from all ages, ethnic groups and levels of technology and innovation.  Important because The Tech is committed to being a significant and responsible institution, of which its community can be proud.<P>

<B>The Solution:  The Interlocking &quot;T&quot;</B><P>

<P>We developed the Interlocking &quot;T&quot; which is an optical illusion, consisting of two interlocking &quot;T&quot; formations.  It suggests that the examination of the world around us allows us to see beyond the expected and uncover the extraordinary within it.  The &quot;mango&quot; colored symbol communicates an inviting sense of playfulness and visually relates to The Techs distinctive Architecture.  To flex with the various marketing opportunities The Tech encounters, the Interlocking &quot;T&quot; is designed to work in three different variations:  symbol-dominant, horizontal and vertical.  The Tech now has a symbol that effectively communicates to mission and one that will continually challenge The Tech to remain on the edge of technology.</P>

<P>In order to keep The Techs new identity under quality control, we developed graphic guidelines.  This effective tool will enable the marketing  department to convey clear, consistent usage of the identity ensuring against any distortion of their image.</P>

<B><P>The Tech &quot;Dream Builders&quot; Capital Campaign</P>
</B><P>On December 10, 1997, The Tech launched a fund-raising program entitled &quot;Dream Builders&quot;  Capital Campaign.  This Campaign targeted high net worth individuals for contributions over $10,000 to assist in completing the building of the new museum.  We collaborated with The Techs Development Department in putting together a direct mail kit that would accomplish the goals of the Campaign.</P>

<P>The timing was such that the Campaign would be launched before the new identity.  Our job was to develop an overall for the brochure without revealing The Techs new identity .  While using the same vibrant colors and qualities that the new identity encompasses, we kept the focus on the new Tech building.</P>

<P>The brochures overall theme is progressive, where one learns about the mission of the campaign which.  We immediately capture the readers attention</P></td>
