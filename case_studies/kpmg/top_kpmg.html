<B>Creating a Magazine to Impact Global Perceptions</B><P></font><font size="-1" face="arial,helvetica">

<B>Background</B><P>

Big 6 accounting and consulting firm KPMG Peat Marwick wanted to continue to broaden its business with an elite global audience.  They opted to publish a magazine, independent of KPMG, that filled a void for global business information.  Our challenge was, first, to help strategically position the magazine and, then, to work with the editor-in-chief to bring the content to life.  As a separate assignment, we created KPMG advertising inserts for each magazine and advertising for the magazine launch.<P>

<B>Identity</B><P>

KPMG had been interested in reviving the name World, the title of an earlier corporate magazine.  Our naming recommendation was World<i>business</i>, with a subtitle "The Global Perspective," which more directly communicated that this was a vital tool for business and government leaders operating in an international marketplace.<P>

<B>Custom Publishing</B><P>

We developed an enduring format for World<i>business</i> that combines classic and urbane style with modern graphics.  From the photojournalistic cover, to the clearly delineated departments for world news, to the use of contemporary illustrations, World<i>business</i> looks quite distinct from publications such as <i>The Economist, Forbes and Fortune.</i>  Yet it carries the same kind of journalistic weight and is deep in content.<P>

<B>Advertising</B><P>

In order to keep from diminishing the magazine's editorial credibility, KPMG advertising was excluded from its pages. Promotion of the company and its services instead took the form of an eight page advertising insert, which we created.<P>
 
The magazine launch was supported by direct response ads we developed that ran in both the <i>New York Times</i> and <i>the Wall Street Journal.</i><P>


<font size=-2 face=arial,helvetica color="#FFFF99"><b>Results</b><br>

The first day <i>the New York Times</i> ad appeared KPMG received more than 300 faxed requests (their machine broke down) and more than 200 toll-free telephone responses from people seeking the magazine.  A second ad in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, pulled the same response.  Due to positive response KPMG will publish World<i>business</i> bi-monthly rather than quarterly, and will accept advertising from prestige companies.</font></td>
