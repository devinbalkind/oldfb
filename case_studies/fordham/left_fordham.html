<B>Changing Perceptions For A New Market Environment</B>
<P></font>
<font size="-1" face="arial,helvetica">

<B>Background</B><P>

<P>For university undergraduate admissions around the country, the 1990s have brought a tough new environment with competition for the better students becoming more and more intense. Fordham, one of the countrys top Jesuit universities, was not immune to the problem and, to complicate matters, research had shown that Fordham was not perceived to have the outstanding academic and professional credentials that it did in reality possess. </P>

<P>Weve helped to reposition the university within the context of the 90s  to prospective students, their parents, high school counselors, alumni, existing students.</P>

<B>Strategy</B><P>

<P>At the core of Fordhams new positioning is a strategy we developed which illustrates how the Jesuit philosophy of critical thinking continues and, in fact, is even more relevant to todays world.  This is illustrated by demonstrating that answers to todays questions are not black or white, right or wrong, and that there is the emotional as well as the intellectual that a university must recognize for the student to truly be a &quot;whole&quot; person. This strategy is reflected in an overall communications platform and a diverse range of communications, including viewbooks, bulletins, direct mail, brochures, posters, promotional materials, and others.</P>

<B>Research</B><P>

<P>Focus groups were held on university admissions materials with high school and university students. Results were that Fordham admissions materials stood out the most, were selected first and generated highest recall. Actual admissions mailings generated a &quot;surprisingly higher and quicker response rate.&quot;</P>

<font size=-2 face=arial,helvetica color="#FFFF99"><b>Results</b><br>
<P>More interest has been generated in Fordham and, after one year with the new program, applications were up 20%. Of equal importance, Fordham is attracting the quality of student they are after.</font></td>
