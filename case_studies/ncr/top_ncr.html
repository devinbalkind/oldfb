<B>Creating a Positioning and Tagline for a Reborn Company</B><P></font><font size="-1" face="arial,helvetica">

<B>Background</B><P>

<P>After five years under the AT&amp;T umbrella, NCR once again became an 
independent company.  During those five years the business had lost its focus and its financial health.  As a first step, the company reverted back to its original name, NCR, from the less memorable, AT&amp;T GIS, and adopted a new corporate symbol.</P>

<B>Strategy</B><P>

<P>As part of a larger positioning analysis, we re-examined where NCR was in the marketplace  and where they wanted to be.  Research showed that NCR was known as an excellent provider of front-end automated teller machines and point-of-sale systems, but relatively unknown in the back-end area, despite their substantial market share.  After a thorough review and primary research, we positioned the company as owning the area of customer transaction solutions with the tagline &quot;Transactions in the Age of the Consumer.&quot;  This tagline now appears in all company and product advertising.</P>

<B>Annual Report</B><P>

<P>The annual report is the first demonstration of NCRs new positioning.  The cover dramatizes the companys capability in both front and back-end systems and leverages the corporate symbol to create a pictorial international language.  The first five spreads, prior to the chairmans letter, amplify the messages of the cover, defining what it means to be &quot;at and behind each customer transaction.&quot;  Subsequent spreads look at the various components of the company and how they serve their various markets.  Over 2-1/2 million copies of the annual report were printed and we also repurposed the report for the Web (www.ncr.com).</P>


<B>Advertising Study</B><P>

<P>NCR has a number of global agencies.  In order for NCR advertising and collateral to be integrated and have the same look and feel as well as tone, we created graphic and personality standards for all the agencies to follow.</P>


<B>Web Site</B><P>

<P>The newly developed NCR Web site is more customer-focused in look and in navigation and is phasing in audience-driven content.</font></td>
