<B>Going Through Change</B><P></font><font size="-1" face="arial,helvetica">

The DuPont annuals for 1992 and 1993 were created to change perceptions internally and externally about who DuPont was and where it was going.  This was of particular importance to Chairman Woolard who firmly believed that change was coming too slow to DuPont and that a change in company culture was essential to the future success of the company.<P>

The cover and contents of the 1992 annual strongly communicated that this was no longer a "waspy, eastern establishment, older company" but a company being transformed into "the most flexible, most aggressive, most responsive and youngest 200-year-old company in the world."<P>

The report was highly controversial, something Woolard was delighted about, as he felt this "bomb dropping" was just what they needed "to really shake things up."<P>

The 1993 annual report focused on the qualities necessary to maintain DuPont's leadership in the years ahead and the people who exhibited these qualities throughout the company.</font></td>
