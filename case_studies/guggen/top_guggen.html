<B>Creating a Campaign to Raise Attendance</B><P></font><font size="-1" face="arial,helvetica">

<B>Background</B><P>

<P>During 1996, the Guggenheim Museum's awareness and attendance was at a low point, just as they planned to reopen their New Media Center in Soho.  In addition, research indicated 70% of the Guggenheim's visitors were tourists; of which 40% were foreigners, reflecting a stronger brand identity abroad than in New York City.  The museum needed to retain its existing visitor base while attracting local New Yorkers, and they needed to appeal to audiences for both Upper Eastside and Soho locations.</P>

<B>Execution</B><P>

<P>By positioning the Guggenheim as "uptown" and "downtown" with graphic branding elements, the campaign allows the museum to have a "global" brand image, while distinctly differentiating the two locations.  The launch utilized the heavily traveled NYC transit system by taking over and "owning" the MTA subway Brand Trains.  The campaign directs local subway riders to both locations by highlighting specific exhibitions.  This effort was supported by a consumer print campaign in local publications like: The New York Times, Village Voice, New York Magazine, and TimeOut New York.  To increase the exposure, we created one-sheet building swipes and rack cards for placement in high traffic areas like the West and East Villages, Chelsea, and Upper Westside.</P>

<font size=-2 face=arial,helvetica color="#FFFF99"><b>Results</b><br>
<P>One year later, research shows a 25% increase in overall attendance for both museums with a substantial increase of ticket sales from local New Yorkers.  In addition to building awareness, the new campaign has helped educate audiences about the Guggenheim Museum's two distinct locations as well as drawing larger crowds to its exhibitions.  Advertising is now being extended to the exterior of New York City buses.</font></td>
