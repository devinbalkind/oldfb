<B>Background</B><P>

For Ron Delsner, the country's largest concert promoter, we've published the Jones Beach Concert Guide, creating design and editorial, selling ad space, and creating promotional tie-ins that appeal to a predominantly young audience.<P>
For example, for advertisers at the Jones Beach four month concert series, Nobody Beats The Wiz has set up concessions, Sony has installed TV monitors to advertise Sony movies and software, HBO has promoted on site and set up a "Sony Week at the Wiz" campaign that tied in the three companies.  Ford has put a Taurus on display at 18 of the 41 concerts and held a sweepstakes that sent concertgoers to local dealerships to see if free concert tickets had been won.  Evian, Drakkar Noir and John Frieda hair products have offered samples.  The Wiz and HBO have included discount coupons in their program ads which were good at music stores or for the on-site sales.  Other participants and advertisers over the years have included:  Coca-Cola (the sponsor of the series), Esquire Watch, Sally Hansen, Haagen-Dazs, the New York Times, Kraft General Foods, Snapple, and a host of local universities.  Over 500,000 copies of the program are distributed each year.
<P>

<font size=-2 face=arial,helvetica color="#FFFF99"><b>Results</b><br>

The first year record revenues were achieved and ad space sold along with outstanding promotional results for participating advertisers.  This trend has continued year after year - with a steady growth in dollars brought in through new and existing advertisers, both national and regional.</font></td>
