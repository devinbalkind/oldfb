<B>A Financially Successful Subscription-based Web Site</B>
<P></font>
<font size="-1" face="arial,helvetica">

<B>Background</B><P>

<P>Gartner Group, the worlds leading independent provider of research and analysis to IT business professionals, originally launched their @vantage Web site on AT&amp;Ts Interchange.  The site provides subscription-based access to Gartners research, analysis and information from content providers, and links to leading IT vendors and service providers Web sites.</P>

<P>When Interchange shut down, Gartner made a decision to redesign and relaunch @vantage on the World Wide Web, and we were brought in to work with them on repositioning, redesigning, launching and marketing the new Web-based service.  The site generates revenues in 3 ways: through subscribers, from content provider "partners" and through links to leading IT vendors and service providers sites.  The goal was to increase revenues overall.  </P>

<B>Positioning</B><P>

<P>@vantage takes complex information that was previously delivered on paper or CD-ROM, disseminates it and makes it easily and quickly available online.  Thus, we positioned the site as the resource business professionals use to keep up with the constant changes in information technology.  The tagline we created says it best:  "@vantage.  Access to Answers."</P>

<B>Branding</B><P>
<P>Branding was key to the site.  For its knowledgeable audience, the site warranted a tone of "sophistication," but a strong presence was also required because it is important for users to know where they are as they link to other sites and move to and from Gartner @vantage.  A three-dimensional graphic identity (portraying infinite space) that works effectively as part of the interface, as background and as navigational icons, goes a long way towards accomplishing that task.  </P>

<B>Design</B><P>
<P>We also redesigned the site with an easy-to-navigate interface to save users time on unproductive Internet searches.  The framework consolidates information from @vantage content providers, otherwise known as @vantage &quot;partners,&quot; who offer a range of expertise with a variety of viewpoints on IT and related topics such as PC software, emerging technologies and networking/telecommunications.  Also provided is access to discussion forums, bulletin boards and chat rooms organized by technology topic with the opportunity to post IT-related questions to industry experts.</P>

<B>Direct Marketing and Promotional Materials</B><P>
<P>Promotional materials give an overview of the web site and brief descriptions   of @vantage &quot;partners&quot; such as Dataquest and Esther Dyson.  They support   the companys efforts in retaining existing customers as well as targeting        future prospects through direct mail.</P>

<B>Advertising</B><P>
Advertising runs in various trade publications and is instrumental in attracting new subscribers.<P>

<font size=-2 face=arial,helvetica color="#FFFF99"><b>Results</b><br>
<P>Since the June 1996 re-launch, @vantage site revenues have increased 10-fold.  It has become one of the most profitable sites on the Web.</font></td>
