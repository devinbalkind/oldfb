<B>Marketing a &quot;Living&quot; Cultural Institution</B>
<P></font>
<font size="-1" face="arial,helvetica">

<B>Background</B><P>

<P>The J. Paul Getty Museum was founded during 1953; by 1981 it had begun its evolution into a multifaceted institution devoted to the arts and humanities; and during December of 1997 there was the public opening of the Getty Center, designed by Richard Meier and located on 742 hilltop acres in west Los Angeles.</P>

<B>Positioning and Nomenclature</B><P>

<P>We were brought in during 1996 to help clarify who the Getty is and what it stands for among its various constituencies, as well as to appeal to a new and broader base.  </P>

<P>One of our most important contributions was to reposition the Getty from what was commonly and mistakenly thought to be just &quot;a museum of antiquities&quot; into the much larger reality.  We, developed the &quot;Institute&quot; concept to replace what had been thought of as &quot;programs&quot; renaming them with more communicative nomenclature, i.e. the Getty Research Institute, The Getty Education Institute, The Getty Information Institute, the Getty Leadership Institute, the Institute for Educators on the Visual Arts.  In this way each Institute is tied to the Getty but is able to have its own identity, take credit for its own initiatives and appeal to its own specific audience.</P>

<P>Overall, we developed a more comprehensive and accurate image for the Getty, which is now known as  &quot;a museum, five institutes, and a grant program.&quot;  This is now the definitive statement used in all Getty communications.</P>

<B>Print Communications</B><P>

<P>To express the new positioning, we created a wide range of communications from annual report, brochures, and media kits to a Web site. </P>

<B>Web Site</B><P>

<P>Now that the new nomenclature of the Getty had gained acceptance, it became integral to the architecture of the Web site which brings together the Museum, Five Institutes and Grant Program.  To appeal to a broad audience, the site is developed to work effectively on a variety of platforms from the lowest to the most sophisticated level (14.4 to T3).  From a design perspective, the Web site ties into the architecture of the new Getty Center; content-wise it gives practical information (maps, hours, exhibits, etc.), provides the Getty &quot;at-a-glance&quot; further emphasizing the message of the Getty being several parts of one whole; gives a &quot;teaser&quot; of the Center itself featuring the work of well-known photographers.  Overall the site encourages the user to want to visit The Getty Center and learn more.</P>

<B>The Getty Center Launch</B><P>

<P>For the Getty Center Launch we created a comprehensive marketing program including advertising, banners seen throughout the streets of Los Angeles, collateral (such as invitations, maps, etc.) and a special area on the web site, which pulled as many as 300,000 hits a day during the launch period.</P>

<font size=-2 face=arial,helvetica color="#FFFF99"><b>Results</b><br>

<P>This launch was such an enormous success that the Getty Center, which was built for a maximum capacity of 5,000 people, had to accommodate 20,000 per day during its opening week.  Since the opening, parking reservations have been booked solid for weekends through October 1988 and for weekdays through August 1988.</font></td>
