PassGo, formerly CKS, is a leading enterprise management software
developer, providing access and control solutions for Global 2000
companies. Its software enables businesses to easily and securely
provide employees access to the information and tools they need to work
productively, while allowing IT administrators to manage corporate
resources from a single point of control.
<p>
Experiencing moderate success and growth over 15 years, PassGo needed to
redefine its position in the marketplace and raise its visibility,
especially in the U.S., in preparation for an IPO within 12 months. FB
created a core positioning of "Access and Control Simplified," and
developed a new name, identity and integrated communications program.
<p>
<b>Naming</b>
<p>
The name PassGo was chosen for both the company and product, not only to
reflect the energetic, entrepreneurial nature of the company, but to
capture the essential benefit of its software: to provide employees
secure access to corporate resources (pass) and enable them to quickly
and easily be productive in their work (go).
<p>
<b>Identity</b>
<p>
The new identity uses color and symbols to convey two core elements,
"access" and "control," of the positioning statement. The bold graphic
approach and the easily grasped nature of the overall mark speak to the
third element of its positioning, "simplified", thereby communicating
the efficiency of the product.
<p>
<b>Brochure</b>
<p>
The first extension of the new identity, the simple cover treatment,
focuses on the new name, symbol and positioning. The first four spreads
amplify the messages of the cover in an advertising format, breaking
down the core positioning and describing the market opportunity.
Subsequent spreads relate the company's history of successfully meeting
the demands of Fortune 2000 firms across the globe, provide details on
the features of its software solutions and speak to its commitment to
customers to ensure their success.
<p>
<b>Website</b>
<p>
As part of the integrated branding effort, we redesigned the corporate
Website to redefine the product offering, explain its comprehensive
solutions, provide case studies and increase functionality.</font></td>
