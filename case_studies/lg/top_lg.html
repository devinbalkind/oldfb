<B>Background</B><P>

<P>LG, formerly Lucky-Goldstar Group, is a multi-national corporation comprised of about 50 companies spanning six business fields.  It is the third largest conglomerate in Korea, operates in 120 different countries and has over 100,000 employees.  In spite of its large size, LG is not well-known on a global basis or in the United States, a market of increased significance to them.</P>

<P>Their goal to achieve $385 billion in revenues by year 2005-- a six-fold increase over LGs 1995 revenues of $64 billion-- requires revolutionary new thinking in running their business.  They also need to broaden LGs image with opinion leaders and decision-makers in the international business communities as well as with existing and potential employees.  They came to us to begin to create communications materials that would clarify who they are and what they stand for, and that would be particularly appealing to a U.S. audience. </P>

<B>Annual Report</B><P>

<P>We created a comprehensive annual report that would:  build awareness and educate the target audience about LG as a future global leader; brand and promote LGs new global identity, products and services; position LG as a &quot;World Class Player&quot; to businesses, customers, joint venture partnerships and employees; and communicate the vision moving towards 2005.</P>

<P>We focused the front half of the report on where LG is today; the second half on where LG is going; and the last on revolutionary ideas together with descriptions of the six business fields and 50 companies.  The tone:  fresh, surprising and intellectually stimulating.</P>

<font size=-2 face=arial,helvetica color="#FFFF99"><b>Results</b><br>
<P>The brochure met managements objective, has been widely well-received, and we have been commissioned to work on a range of communications materials.</font></td>
