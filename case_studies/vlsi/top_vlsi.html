<B>Background</B><P>

VLSI Technology, Inc., a San Jose based company specializing in custom silicon chips for the computer, communications and entertainment industries, needed to raise its visibility among the widening business and consumer market for high-complexity integrated circuits.  They commissioned us to develop an integrated message utilizing advertising, the annual report, direct marketing, and collateral materials. In creating the positioning, we also introduced a new category within the industry, coined "Mass Customized Silicon" - an evolution of ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuits).<P>

Annual Report<P>

The first communication -- the annual report -- told a two-fold story of growth. First, the company was poised to grow because it had developed new methodologies for the marketplace in chip technologies; second, custom-designed chips had grown into a broad consumer market.  The story was told in an aggressive, entertaining manner and met the concerns of security analysts head-on (explaining, for example, why the stock had been on a rollercoaster ride and why it was poised to take off).<P>

An annual report alone rarely changes the price of a stock.  In this case, however, the stock rose dramatically immediately after the annual came out -- and there was little other relevant news at the time.<P>

Capabilities Brochure<P>

The capabilities brochure outlined the custom chip manufacturing methods VLSI used to help its clients master the "madness" of the explosive and time-sensitive technology markets.<P>

Advertising<P>

Advertising features sharp bladed instruments and the unifying tag line "VLSI. Always the cutting edge."  Aimed at engineers and top levelcorporate decision-makers, the ads reinforce the relevance of custom chip technology to the mass market.  The use of minimal visuals and an irreverent, humorous tone separate them from ads typically found in technology trades (sample copy: ""Mass Customized" means our cell-based chip design enable 3 in 10 digital cellular phones in the world.  That's 17 million less people tripping over a phone cord.  VLSI. Always on the cutting edge.").</font></td>
