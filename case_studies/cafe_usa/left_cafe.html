<B>Launching A New Advertising and Entertainment Medium</B>
<P></font>
<font size="-1" face="arial,helvetica">

At a time when it is increasingly hard to reach consumers with an advertising message, the creators of Cafe USA see a unique marketing opportunity in reaching the millions of American shoppers who visit food courts in retail malls.  Led by the former heads of Backer Spielvogel and J. Walter Thompson, Cafe USA is a new kind of television network.  It will bring entertainment and news programming, as well as advertising tagged with the names of mall retailers, to a captive audience in more than 700 malls nationwide.  Cafe USA will reach consumers just yards away from the point-of-purchase - in food courts, where, statistics indicate, a shopper's average visit is about 25 minutes.<P>

To launch this new medium, we created a strong identity, promotional materials, advertising, and an interactive multi-media presentation aimed at potential investors, mall management, advertisers, and retailers.  We also designed all on-air graphics for the network, including identity, titles and openings for the individual program segments, which feature home furnishings, music, fashion, movies, and news.<P>

<B>Interactive Multimedia Business-to-Business Presentation</B><P>

To help introduce Cafe USA and demonstrate its power to influence shoppers at the point of purchase, we created an interactive sales presentation.<P>

This choice of a multi-media selling tool serves to reinforce that Cafe USA offers a new and powerful way to communicate at the vanguard of the media revolution. Running from about 15 to 40 minutes, according to the presenter's needs, the presentation sets out the key demographic and other data supporting the strength of the Cafe USA concept in a lively and compelling fashion.  The interactive format enables the presenter to move easily to any point in the presentation, and includes-live-action video sequences of interviews with shoppers and retailers along with providing a look at Cafe USA's graphics, programming and food court installations.<P>

<font size=-2 face=arial,helvetica color="#FFFF99"><b>Results</b><br>
Cafe USA's interactive presentation has been shown by a team of presenters in nearly 100 sites nationwide to an enthusiastic response.  Master Card, Lee, Reebok, and Nintendo are among the national advertisers who have already signed on, with many more now in the negotiating stage.  The project has moved into several new test sites. Early press coverage has included stories in the <i>Wall Street Journal, Advertising Age, Women's Wear Daily, Shopping Centers Today, and The Delaney Report.</i></font></td>
