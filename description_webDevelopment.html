      <P>At Frankfurt Balkind, we see new media as a unique opportunity to bring your brand to life. It covers the development of corporate, marketing, and e-commerce web sites, intranets, and extranets.</P>

<P>The fact is, the web is the only truly integrated medium. It is identity, it's marketing communications, it's advertising, it's sound, it's video. It can inform, offer the product for sale, make the sale, and support the customer relationship. Because our agency is integrated from the strategic level outward, we can show you how to leverage your brand powerfully across every kind of usage on the web.
Our unique approach puts web strategists together with people experienced in traditional marketing and business, who uncover opportunities by looking at web branding from every point of view.
Our new media staff spans the full gamut of professionals: Strategists, who create web strategy based on business and marketing objectives; information architects, who reinforce the brand and create logical navigation; usability experts, who ensure the site is intuitive for users; editors and writers, who develop content that both resonates with target audiences and works in modular hierarchies; creative directors and designers, who create the user interface and design the look and feel that enhances the brand; technologists and programmers, who specify technology requirements, develop, and integrate software; quality assurance experts, who check the final work across platforms, different technologies, and browsers; and of course the project managers, producers and marketing account executives, who hold everything together, liaise with the client and, after the launch, track results and direct refinements.
Throughout the process, we are especially adept at helping you build consensus across business units. This ability comes from our vast experience in producing both corporate and product-focused communications that require wide-ranging internal alignment.</P>
